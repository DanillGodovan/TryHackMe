# TryHackMe: Cybersecurity Learning Journal

This repository documents my learning journey through various TryHackMe rooms, focusing on offensive security techniques such as enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and red team tactics.

All activities were completed using educational labs in accordance with TryHackMe’s terms of service. This project serves both as a personal knowledge base and a public showcase of hands-on cybersecurity skills.
