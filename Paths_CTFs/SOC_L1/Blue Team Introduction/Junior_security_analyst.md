#### SOC and Your Team

You are not alone in monitoring the alerts and securing the whole company. A lot of people support you with your job. SOC engineers are configuring the security tools, senior analysts are helping with complex attacks, and a manager is trying to keep everything under control. A Security Operations Center (SOC) is your big team that protects the company, each role in its own way. Now, let's meet your colleagues!

#### Your Daily Duties

Are you inspired by your colleagues' work and wish to advance to their roles? Cyber security is a broad field, and with time you'll find the path that excites you most. But before that, you need to gain work experience as a Junior Security Analyst. Along the way, you'll have many lessons and challenges, where you may:

- Detect and prevent a data stealer infection on a coworker's laptop
- Analyze and stop a phishing campaign targeting the finance team
- Participate in a bigger incident, such as a full-scale ransomware attack
- Team up with your teammates to build detection rules and automations
- Go beyond cyber and understand how companies operate from the inside

## A Day in the Life of a Security Analyst

#### Being a Security Analyst

Being in the defensive frontline is not easy, as you have to constantly learn new things. During a busy 8-hour shift, you might be buried under a mountain of "tickets" - the alerts and tasks that you need to resolve in a timely manner. Still, the job is fun and rewarding, especially after you stop a real threat from damaging your organization. Even better, it is fascinating to know how the attacks you hear about in the news actually happen in the real world.
